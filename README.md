## 11) Next suggested actions


- I can generate the actual files for you (full `app.py`, `src/` files, tests) right now in this chat and provide them as a downloadable zip. Would you like me to create those files next?
- Or we can move to **Step 2** (build the base Streamlit app skeleton) and implement UI incrementally.

If you want adjustments to the structure (e.g., prefer `src/app.py` instead of top-level `app.py`, or using `poetry` / `pipenv`), tell me and I'll update the layout.
